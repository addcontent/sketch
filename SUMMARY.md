# Summary of Sketch Architecture and Adaptation for Pentesting

## 1. High-Level Overview of the Sketch Repository

Sketch is a sophisticated and modular framework for building LLM-powered agents. Its primary design purpose is to act as a software engineering assistant, capable of understanding and modifying codebases. However, its core architecture is generic and flexible, built on a set of well-defined components that can be adapted for other use cases.

## 2. Core Architectural Concepts

We identified several key design patterns that define how the agent operates:

*   **Modular Tools (`llm.Tool`):** The agent's capabilities are defined by a collection of tools. Each tool has a name, a description for the LLM, a JSON schema for its inputs, and a `Run` function in Go that executes its logic. This makes the agent's skillset easily extensible.
*   **The Agent Loop (`loop` package):** The central brain of the application is a loop that:
    1.  Sends the current context and available tools to an LLM.
    2.  Receives a tool-use request from the LLM.
    3.  Executes the requested tool via its `Run` function.
    4.  Feeds the result back into the loop for the LLM's next decision.
*   **Service Abstraction (`llm.Service`):** The framework is not tied to a single LLM provider. It uses a `Service` interface, with concrete implementations for Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, making the backend swappable.
*   **Record-and-Replay Testing (`httprr`):** The project relies heavily on a record-and-replay system for testing. This allows developers to record real HTTP API interactions into trace files and then "replay" them during tests. This makes the test suite fast, deterministic, and independent of live API keys or network connectivity.

## 3. Deep Dive on Key Components

We analyzed several specific files to understand their roles:

*   **`skabandclient/skabandclient.go` (The Control Plane):** This is the secure nerve center. It handles authenticating the user via public/private key cryptography to a central "skaband" server, which in return provides temporary, session-specific LLM API keys. It also establishes a persistent, inverted communication channel, allowing the server to push commands to the agent.
*   **`skribe/skribe.go` (The Logger):** A context-aware, structured logging framework built around Go's `slog` library. It automatically enriches log messages with contextual data (like session and tool IDs) and redacts sensitive information like API keys.
*   **`dockerimg/tunnel_manager.go` (The Network Bridge):** An automated port-forwarding service. It monitors for services started by the agent inside its Docker container and automatically creates SSH tunnels to expose them on the user's `localhost`, enabling seamless interaction with web UIs or other tools.
*   **`httprr/rr.go` (The Testing Backbone):** The implementation of the record-and-replay system used for creating reliable and hermetic tests for all network-dependent code.
*   **`claudetool/onstart/analyze.go` (The Reconnaissance Module):** A tool that runs at the start of a session to give the LLM initial context. In its current form, it's designed to analyze a codebase by reading `README` files and summarizing source code files.

## 4. Adapting the Architecture for Penetration Testing

The main focus of our discussion was a thought experiment: adapting this codebase from a coding assistant to a **penetration testing assistant** using Kali Linux tools.

We concluded that the architecture is a **strong and highly suitable foundation** for this new use case, but would require significant, targeted changes:

1.  **Sandboxing and Environment:** Instead of the default environment, the agent would be configured to run inside a **Kali Linux Docker container**. This immediately provides a full suite of pentesting tools.
2.  **Handling Interactivity:** The core `bash` tool, which currently uses a simple `exec.Command`, would be re-engineered to use a **pseudo-terminal (`pty`) library**. This is the critical change needed to manage interactive shell sessions for tools like `sqlmap` or `msfconsole`.
3.  **Re-imagining Analysis:** The `analyze.go` module would be completely rewritten. Instead of analyzing source code, its new purpose would be to perform **initial network reconnaissance**. It would use tools like `ip addr` and `nmap` to understand its own network configuration and perform an initial scan of the target, feeding that structured data to the LLM for strategic planning.
4.  **Tool Output Parsing:** A key principle for this adaptation would be to create wrapper tools that don't just return raw terminal output. For example, an `nmap_scan` tool would run the command and then **parse the XML output into a clean JSON structure** before giving it to the LLM, making the information much more actionable.

In essence, our plan leverages the agent's core loop and modular tool architecture but swaps out the specific tool implementations and the operating environment to pivot from a software domain to a network security domain.
