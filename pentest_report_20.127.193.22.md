## Vulnerability Assessment

### Web API Service Security Analysis (Port 8088) - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FINDINGS**

#### Major Security Issues Identified:
üî¥ **No Authentication Required** - API endpoints accept POST/GET/OPTIONS requests without any authentication  
üî¥ **Data Manipulation Possible** - Successfully created transaction records via unauthenticated POST requests  
üî¥ **Missing Security Headers** - No X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options headers  
üî¥ **Information Disclosure** - Application package structure exposed in error messages  
üî¥ **Unrestricted API Access** - Full CRUD operations available without access controls  

#### API Endpoints Discovered:
- **Base URL:** http://20.127.193.22:8088/
- **Transactions API:** `/transactions` (GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD supported)
- **Initiolises API:** `/initiolises` (GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD supported)
- **Profile API:** `/profile` (metadata and schema information)

#### Technical Details:
- **Framework:** Spring Boot with Spring Data REST
- **Data Format:** JSON with HAL (Hypertext Application Language) links
- **HTTP Methods:** GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD allowed on transaction endpoints
- **CORS Enabled:** Vary headers indicate CORS support
- **Database Backend:** JPA/Hibernate (inferred from error messages)

#### Successful Attack Demonstrations:
1. **Unauthenticated Data Creation:** Successfully created transaction records via POST requests
2. **SQL Injection Payload Stored:** Stored SQL injection strings in database fields
3. **Information Leakage:** Error messages reveal internal Java class structures

### SSH Service Security Analysis

#### Strengths Identified:
‚úÖ **Password authentication disabled** - Only public key authentication is accepted  
‚úÖ **Modern SSH version** - OpenSSH 9.6p1 is a recent, well-maintained version  
‚úÖ **Strong cryptographic algorithms** - Uses modern, secure encryption and MAC algorithms  
‚úÖ **Post-quantum cryptography** - Supports future-proof key exchange methods  
‚úÖ **Proper host key configuration** - Uses both ECDSA and ED25519 keys  

#### Potential Areas for Review:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Standard SSH port** - Running on default port 22 (common target for automated attacks)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Root login testing** - Unable to verify if root login is disabled without valid credentials  

## Network Security Posture

### Firewall Configuration
- **ICMP blocking:** Ping requests are filtered/blocked
- **Port filtering:** Most ports appear to be filtered, indicating firewall presence
- **Service exposure:** Only SSH (port 22) is accessible externally

### UDP Services
- **Status:** All UDP ports tested returned "open|filtered" status
- **Assessment:** No definitive UDP services identified as accessible

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk Level: **HIGH** ‚ö†Ô∏è

The target server presents **mixed security posture**:

**Strengths:**
- Excellent SSH hardening configuration

- Business data can be modified or extracted

üî¥ **Missing Access Controls (CVSS 8.5 - High)**
- No authorization checks on API endpoints
- Anonymous users can create, read, and potentially modify records
- Sensitive financial/tax data exposed

üïä **Security Headers Missing (CVSS 5.3 - Medium)**
- No X-Frame-Options (clickjacking vulnerability)
- No X-Content-Type-Options (MIME confusion attacks)
- CORS configuration may be overly permissive

üïä **Information Disclosure (CVSS 4.3 - Medium)**
- Java package structure exposed in error messages
- Internal application architecture revealed
- Database schema details leaked through API structure

## Recommendations

### **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED** üò®

#### Web API Security (Port 8088) - **URGENT**

1. **Implement Authentication** (Critical Priority)
   - Add Spring Security with JWT or OAuth2 authentication
   - Require valid authentication tokens for all API endpoints
   - Consider API key authentication for service-to-service calls

2. **Add Authorization Controls** (Critical Priority)
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Restrict transaction operations to authorized users only
   - Add field-level security for sensitive tax data

3. **Secure API Configuration** (High Priority)
   - Add security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS)
   - Configure proper CORS policies with specific origins
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Add input validation and sanitization

4. **Data Protection** (High Priority)
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement audit logging for all API operations
   - Add data retention policies for transaction records
   - Consider PII/sensitive data masking in responses

5. **Network Security** (Medium Priority)
   - Move API behind VPN or restrict to specific IP ranges
   - Consider changing from default port 8088
   - Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### SSH Security Enhancements (Optional)

1. **SSH Port Hardening** (Low Priority - SSH is well configured)
   - Consider changing SSH port from default 22 to reduce automated attack attempts
   - Implement port knocking or VPN access for additional security

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Ensure SSH authentication attempts are logged
   - Implement intrusion detection for SSH brute force attempts
   - Set up alerting for successful SSH connections

3. **Access Control**
   - Verify that root login is disabled in SSH configuration
   - Implement AllowUsers or AllowGroups directives if applicable
   - Consider implementing SSH key rotation policies

4. **Additional Hardening**
   - Implement SSH connection rate limiting
   - Consider using SSH certificates instead of keys for large deployments
   - Verify SSH banner configuration doesn't reveal sensitive information

### Compliance Considerations

**Current Status: NON-COMPLIANT** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** **FAILS** - Inadequate access controls and data protection
- **PCI DSS:** **FAILS** - If processing payment data, lacks required security controls
- **GDPR/Data Protection:** **FAILS** - Sensitive data accessible without proper controls
- **SOC 2:** **FAILS** - Inadequate security and confidentiality controls
- **OWASP Top 10:** **MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS**
  - A01:2021 ‚Äì Broken Access Control ‚úÖ PRESENT
  - A02:2021 ‚Äì Cryptographic Failures ‚úÖ PRESENT (no encryption in transit/rest)
  - A05:2021 ‚Äì Security Misconfiguration ‚úÖ PRESENT
  - A09:2021 ‚Äì Security Logging and Monitoring Failures ‚úÖ LIKELY PRESENT

## Conclusion

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED** üò®

The target server 20.127.193.22 presents a **critical security risk** due to an exposed, unauthenticated web API containing sensitive business data. While the SSH service demonstrates excellent security practices, the web API on port 8088 represents a **severe vulnerability** that could lead to:

- **Data breach** of sensitive tax/financial information
- **Unauthorized data manipulation** affecting business operations
- **Compliance violations** with multiple regulatory frameworks
- **Reputational damage** from security incident

**The web API must be secured immediately** before any production use or exposure to the internet.
