# Penetration Testing Report: 20.127.193.22

**Date:** 2025-06-27  
**Target:** 20.127.193.22  
**Scope:** Single server security assessment  
**Methodology:** NIST SP 800-115 / OWASP Testing Guide  

## Executive Summary

A penetration test was conducted on the target server 20.127.193.22. The assessment revealed a single SSH service running on the default port with strong security configurations. No critical vulnerabilities were identified.

## Discovered Services

### SSH Service (Port 22/TCP)
- **Service:** OpenSSH 9.6p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu13.12
- **Status:** Open and accessible
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Linux
- **Protocol:** SSH-2.0

#### SSH Configuration Analysis
- **Authentication Methods:** Public key authentication only
- **Password Authentication:** Disabled (security best practice)
- **Host Key Algorithms:** 
  - ECDSA (256-bit)
  - ED25519 (256-bit)
- **Encryption Algorithms:** Strong modern ciphers (ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-CTR, AES-GCM)
- **MAC Algorithms:** HMAC-SHA2 variants and UMAC
- **Key Exchange:** Modern algorithms including post-quantum (sntrup761x25519-sha512)

## Vulnerability Assessment

### SSH Service Security Analysis

#### Strengths Identified:
✅ **Password authentication disabled** - Only public key authentication is accepted  
✅ **Modern SSH version** - OpenSSH 9.6p1 is a recent, well-maintained version  
✅ **Strong cryptographic algorithms** - Uses modern, secure encryption and MAC algorithms  
✅ **Post-quantum cryptography** - Supports future-proof key exchange methods  
✅ **Proper host key configuration** - Uses both ECDSA and ED25519 keys  

#### Potential Areas for Review:
⚠️ **Standard SSH port** - Running on default port 22 (common target for automated attacks)  
⚠️ **Root login testing** - Unable to verify if root login is disabled without valid credentials  

## Network Security Posture

### Firewall Configuration
- **ICMP blocking:** Ping requests are filtered/blocked
- **Port filtering:** Most ports appear to be filtered, indicating firewall presence
- **Service exposure:** Only SSH (port 22) is accessible externally

### UDP Services
- **Status:** All UDP ports tested returned "open|filtered" status
- **Assessment:** No definitive UDP services identified as accessible

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk Level: **LOW**

The target server demonstrates strong security posture with:
- Minimal attack surface (single exposed service)
- Proper SSH hardening configuration
- Effective firewall implementation
- Modern cryptographic standards

### Specific Findings:

#### No Critical Vulnerabilities Identified
- No known CVEs for OpenSSH 9.6p1
- No authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- No weak cryptographic configurations

#### No High-Risk Misconfigurations
- Password authentication properly disabled
- Strong algorithm selections
- Appropriate service exposure

## Recommendations

### Security Enhancements (Optional)

1. **SSH Port Hardening** (Low Priority)
   - Consider changing SSH port from default 22 to reduce automated attack attempts
   - Implement port knocking or VPN access for additional security

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Ensure SSH authentication attempts are logged
   - Implement intrusion detection for SSH brute force attempts
   - Set up alerting for successful SSH connections

3. **Access Control**
   - Verify that root login is disabled in SSH configuration
   - Implement AllowUsers or AllowGroups directives if applicable
   - Consider implementing SSH key rotation policies

4. **Additional Hardening**
   - Implement SSH connection rate limiting
   - Consider using SSH certificates instead of keys for large deployments
   - Verify SSH banner configuration doesn't reveal sensitive information

### Compliance Considerations

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Compliant with identification and protection functions
- **CIS Controls:** Aligns with secure configuration and access control best practices
- **SOC 2:** Demonstrates appropriate security measures for availability and security

## Conclusion

The target server 20.127.193.22 demonstrates excellent security posture with minimal attack surface and proper security configurations. The SSH service is properly hardened with modern cryptographic standards and authentication controls. No immediate security remediation is required.
