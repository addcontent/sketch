-rw-rw-rw- 1 ftp ftp              70 Jun 27 10:19 test.txt (contains password)
```

**Exposed Sensitive Data:**
```
File: test.txt
Content: "this is the password: Password.000000000000000000000000000000002020202"
```

**Proof of Concept:**

- Could be valid for other systems or services

**System Information:**
- Windows system identified (TTL=127 in ping responses)
- FileZilla FTP Server version disclosed
- SMB protocol versions enumerated

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Risk Analysis

#### **CRITICAL RISK** - Anonymous FTP Access
- **CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
- **Impact:** Complete confidentiality and integrity breach
- **Exploitability:** Trivial - no authentication required
- **Scope:** System and potentially network-wide compromise

#### **HIGH RISK** - Sensitive Data Exposure
- **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)
- **Impact:** Credential compromise, lateral movement potential
- **Exploitability:** Direct access via anonymous FTP
- **Scope:** Authentication credentials for other systems

#### **MEDIUM RISK** - Information Disclosure
- **CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Medium)
- **Impact:** System reconnaissance, attack planning
- **Exploitability:** Service enumeration and banner grabbing
- **Scope:** Network topology and system identification

### Attack Scenarios

1. **Data Exfiltration:**
   - Attacker accesses FTP anonymously
   - Downloads all sensitive files
   - Obtains passwords and confidential information

2. **Malware Deployment:**
   - Attacker uploads malicious files via FTP
   - Files executed by legitimate users
   - System compromise and lateral movement

3. **Credential Abuse:**
   - Obtained password used for privilege escalation
   - Access to other systems using discovered credentials
   - Network-wide compromise

## Network Security Posture

### System Identification
- **Operating System:** Microsoft Windows (TTL=127)
- **Network Segment:** Internal (192.168.100.x)
- **Connectivity:** Full network access confirmed

### Service Exposure
- **Critical Services:** FTP (21), SMB (445), RPC (135), NetBIOS (139)
- **Unknown Services:** Ports 5040, 7680 require further investigation
- **UDP Services:** NetBIOS Name Service active

## Recommendations

### **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED** üò®

#### 1. **Secure FTP Service** (Critical Priority)
- **DISABLE anonymous FTP access immediately**
- Remove or secure sensitive files from FTP directory
- Implement strong authentication requirements
- Consider disabling FTP service if not required

#### 2. **Credential Management** (Critical Priority)
- Change all passwords referenced in exposed files
- Implement secure password policies
- Use centralized credential management
- Audit all systems for password reuse

#### 3. **Access Control Review** (High Priority)
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Review all service configurations
- Disable unnecessary services (ports 5040, 7680 if unused)
- Configure proper file permissions

#### 4. **Network Segmentation** (High Priority)
- Isolate sensitive systems from general network
- Implement network access controls
- Monitor internal network traffic
- Consider VLAN segmentation

### **Security Hardening** (Medium Priority)

#### Windows Security Configuration
- Enable Windows Firewall with restrictive rules
- Disable unnecessary Windows services
- Apply latest security patches
- Configure audit logging

#### Service Hardening

- Harden RPC and NetBIOS services
- Implement service-specific access controls
- Regular security updates for FileZilla

#### Monitoring and Detection
- Implement file integrity monitoring
- Log all FTP access attempts
- Monitor for suspicious network activity
- Set up intrusion detection alerts
